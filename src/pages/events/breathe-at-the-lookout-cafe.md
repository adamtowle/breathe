  Inhale, exhale and Breathe. Now you’re relaxed, we can announce our return
  home to Cardiff in a new, secluded setting.\

  \

  We decided to go on a short hiatus since our stellar Amsterdam event, but now
  we’re back with a waterside venue showcasing the stunning views of Cardiff
  Bay. As our extended family has grown, we’ve developed our own brand of
  inclusive style and all-encompassing sound, so naturally we’ve assembled a top
  notch lineup featuring our god-tier mates, classic Breathe residents and some
  ever-so special additions.\

  \

  We’ll be kitting out our idyllic new venue with the revered, custom Worthy
  Sound system and carrying out some fitting aesthetic work to the dancefloor.
  All the work going into the party is designed to create the perfect
  atmosphere, so in lieu of standard ticket prices we will simply be giving
  everyone the chance to make donations within their own means. Allow whatever
  you pay to be an extension of your trust, happiness and familiarity with
  Breathe. Any donation is truly welcome.\

  \

  This one is simply about coming together and celebrating. Big spending doesn’t
  necessarily make the party memorable for anyone!\
